# Castle-Siege
🎮 Castle Siege: Math Mayhem  Castle Siege: Math Mayhem is a 2D educational tower defense game developed using Unity as a Final Year Project. The game is designed to improve arithmetic fluency among primary school students through interactive and engaging gameplay.

📚 Project Overview

Many primary school students struggle with basic arithmetic and often find traditional math practice boring or stressful. This project introduces a game-based learning approach, where mathematics is integrated directly into gameplay.

Players must defend their castle from enemy waves by building and upgrading towers. However, towers can only be placed after answering math questions correctly. This ensures that learning and gameplay happen together.
